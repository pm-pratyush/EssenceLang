**Project Title: EssenceLang - Unveiling the Core Principles of Programming Languages in Racket**

# EssenceLang

Welcome to EssenceLang, an ambitious project that embarks on the implementation journey of parsers and interpreters for four distinct custom languages. Each language, inspired by the principles outlined in the recommended book "Essentials Of Programming Languages," is crafted to illustrate essential concepts such as lexical scoping, recursion, and foundational language constructs.

## Introduction

EssenceLang is a comprehensive exploration of key programming language concepts, guided by the principles elucidated in the book "Essentials Of Programming Languages." This project provides hands-on experience in implementing parsers and interpreters for languages that embody fundamental programming language constructs.

## Languages Included

1. **MapCode** : A language designed to showcase the power and versatility of mapping functions over data structures.
2. **ArithmeticLanguage** : An expressive language focusing on arithmetic operations, laying the foundation for understanding language semantics.
3. **LexicalScoping** : Illustrating the significance of lexical scoping in programming languages, fostering a deep understanding of variable visibility.
4. **RecursiveLanguage** : A language emphasizing the beauty and practicality of recursion in solving computational problems.

## Getting Started

To embark on your journey with EssenceLang, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/essence-lang.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd essence-lang`
3. Choose a language directory, e.g., `cd lexical-scoping`
4. Refer to the README within the language directory for specific instructions on running examples and experimenting.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to keep languages organized and easily extensible. Primary directories include:

* **map-code**
* **arithmetic-language**
* **lexical-scoping**
* **recursive-language**
* **shared** : Common utilities and modules shared across languages.

## Implementation Details

Each language directory contains a detailed README with insights into language syntax, features, and implementation specifics. Delve into the README of the language you're interested in for a deeper understanding.
