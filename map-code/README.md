# Assignment 2 : Map Code

In this assignment, you will implement some common algorithms using mapcode.
The mapcode combinator is given in `main.rkt` along with an example
implementation of factorial.

Algorithms to be implemented are given in the `main.rkt` file. For each
algorithm, you also have to implement 5 test cases, using RackUnit. Example
usage of RackUnit is given for factorial example.
